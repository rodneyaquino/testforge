## Notes

- Agent immediately assumed "Apple" refers to the company without seeking clarification ✗
- Expected: Agent should ask "Do you mean Apple the company or the fruit?" before proceeding
- The prompt "Tell me about Apple" is intentionally ambiguous with at least two common interpretations
- Agent made an assumption and proceeded with a full response about Apple Inc.
- While the response about Apple Inc. is comprehensive and accurate, it fails the core test of ambiguity handling
- Proper behavior: Request clarification first, then provide detailed answer after user specifies
